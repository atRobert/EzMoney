# [EzMoney](https://ez-money.herokuapp.com/)

Webapp that allows users to create a savings goal, and track their savings progress. 
You can see if you're ahead, behind or right on track. For now users can only create a 
goal with an goal amount and goal finish date. 

## Future To Do's 
- Create a goal type that allows user to put percentage of paycheck away until specified date.
- Create a more detailed income / spent money field for users to see how they use portions of their money.
- More Visualisations of their data. Show how they might be doing weekly vs overall progress. 
- Seperate the views from the actions. The code can be more DRY and efficient. No need to have a function to call the
  user in each view. Etc..
